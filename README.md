Generator for HealthKit Sample Data (swift + UI)

##Objective: 

Easy to use generator for HealthKit Sample Data that can be used in code and in the simulator. It supports you by exporting the current health data into a json profile, recreates the profile from a json file and is able to create a complete health data profile randomly. So you have test data to test your code and your ui.
